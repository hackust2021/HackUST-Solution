# HackUST-Elder-Solution
This project is aimed to help with inconvenience of the elder people. We attempt to control a wheelchair with the mobile phone and voice instruction. So that the wheel chair can be guided to places as the user's wish.
Solution consists of two parts: voice recognition and path plannning.
Due to the limitation of the situation, we are currently not able to implement the full solution with a real wheelchair. The path planning algorithm is therefore shown with simulation. This can be found in a_star.py.
There is also an app demo based on [chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/), where the apk and full code can be found in this repo.
